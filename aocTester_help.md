Advent of Code Solver
=====================

This program executes the various provided tests.

The following operations are possible:

- `node aocTester.js` to to test every single year (this might take a long while!)
- `node aocTester.js 2015` to test every day of the given year (e.g. 2015)
- `node aocTester.js 2015 5` to test a given day in the given year (e.g. the fifth day of 2015)
- `node aocTester.js 2015 5 B` to test a given solver in the given year and day (e.g. the B solution of the fifth day of 2015)

optional arguments:
- `--space`, `-s`: test the smallest possible code variant.
