A collection of Advent of Code solvers.  
This is a work in progress.

Tasks are Grouped and sorted by year, day, and A/B tasks.  
They are further divided into
- Time: execution time minimal implementation (avoiding major quadratic time traps while maintaining readable code, not a perfect time-optimisation without lambdas)
- Space: file size minimal implementation (code golf)
